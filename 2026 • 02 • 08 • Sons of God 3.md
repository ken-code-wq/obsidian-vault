- Zephaniah 3:15-17 KJV
	[15] The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more. [16] In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. [17] ==The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty;== he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing. 
	- Judgement is the absence of God
