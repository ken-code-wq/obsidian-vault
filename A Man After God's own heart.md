### __Psalm 89:19-20__

- [19] - Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one,
  and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty;
  I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
- [20] - I have found David my servant;
  with my holy oil have I anointed him:

The God is always searching for someone, like a scout 

The best thing to do is to know what God is looking for and position yourself 

God has what He is looking for

Most attimes people despise who God chooses. 

Like how the football scout chooses
- Its always about the coach, not the player

There are a few points God is looking for
1. 2 Chronicles 16:8-9
   - Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.
   - For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
   - [ ] God is looking for a **__PERFECT HEART__**__.__ Not necessarily a perfect character, but a heart that is aligned towards God.
   - [ ] A Man who is thinking of God
   - [ ] A heart that is looking for God
         - [ ] Listen to __Maintaining a Perfect Heart__
   - A perfect heart is the core subject of life. It is somewhere that errors must not be in
   - Like Saul and David
   - What is a perfect heart?
   - Isaiah 66:1-2
     - Thus saith the LORD,
       The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool:
       where is the house that ye build unto me?
       and where is the place of my rest?
     - For all those things hath mine hand made,
       and all those things have been, saith the LORD:
       but to this man will I look,
       __even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit(THAT IS A PERFECT HEART) and trembleth at my word.__
   - It is like a heart that is alreaddy looking for God
   - When your heart is not right, nothing would work. What you do don’t matter if your heart is not right
   - You can be appointed by men but not promoted by God
   - Acts 13:21
     - And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, **__a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.__**
     - A man after God’s own heart is one who will fulfill the will of God
   - Acts 7:14
     - Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
2. Ezekiel 22:30
   - And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none
   - God is looking for **__INTERCERSSORS__**
   - With a world where everybody is looking for themselves, God searches for someone who is looking out for others and praying for others
   - When God finds an intercessor He has found someone with a mutual interest, this is where friendship is developed
   - The reason why God doesn’t play with our Pastors and intercessors is because there are not many people like that
   - It takes God for a man not be selfish
   - [ ] Focus on God everyother thing would chase you
   - When God comes to town He is not looking for those who are seeking for things, He is comes for people who are looking for others to be saved
   - [ ] When you wake up in the morning what do you think about? Do you think about the pople in the city? Or are you waiting for God to answer your requests?
3. Isaiah 6:8
   - Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.

> Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things?
> Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day?
> or shall a nation be born at once?
> for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.

- 
  - God is looking for **__WHO HE WILL SEND.__**
