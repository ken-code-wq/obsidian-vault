- Today didn't start so awesome
- Yesterday I fell asleep 
- and it's not like I was lazy or something, I was tired. Trust me
- and I am in the washroom right now,I'm talking with Holy Ghost and He was like it's like I don't trust that He can energize me when I'm tired
- and I noticed I do that a lot.when I'm tired no nothing, it's like I'm off.
- of course sometimes I don't sleep, but mostly especially on Saturday nights, when I am tired very tired I sleep
- And it's not like I intentionally sleep, I fall asleep unintentionally or I set an alarm and I don't hear it. Probably turned off by someone 
- So Holy Ghost was "do you know that you can pray for your invitees during the week"
- and that's so true.
- Because I mostly wait till Saturday to do so
- And yesterday too, brother Emmanuel mentioned that I can reduce my prayer times to get more rest.
- Holy Spirit literally just brought it to me that I didn't sleep well or enough on Friday night to Saturday morning 
- I think because I came to campus with High hopes and goals, I thought God would skip some steps with me

- so you can see how much I walked and slept the night before Saturday 
- Holy Ghost instructed to start a journal of instructions and indicate which ones I have taken
- so it's in [[Journal of Instructions]]
